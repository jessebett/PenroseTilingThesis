\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost I'd like to thank my supervisor Dr. Miroslav Lovric for his guidance on this project. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity to self-direct my research questions and pursue a project through curiosity, intrigue, and a bit of aestheticism. Miroslav enabled all of this through his supervision. But I'd also like to thank him for his influence far before the supervision of this project when, as the instructor for first year math in Integrated Science 1A24, he introduced me to Mathematics and irrevocably altered the direction of my subsequent studies. Thank you for introducing me to Mathematics as it is, an art.\\
I would also like to acknowledge my peers and faculty in the Integrated Science program, who have taught me how to ask deep questions about the universe. And, to my peers and faculty in the Mathematics Department, who have taught me how to begin answering them.
