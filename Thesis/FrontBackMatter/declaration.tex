A significant effort in this project was the creation of graphics illustrating the various features of Penrose tilings. In doing so, a Mathematica library for the creation and visualization of Penrose tilings was written. The majority of the figures found in this thesis were produced with this library. Figures not produced for this thesis will be otherwise noted. The Mathematica library, including all code to generate this document, the figures within, and an accompanying Beamer presentation, is available on a GitHub repository.
