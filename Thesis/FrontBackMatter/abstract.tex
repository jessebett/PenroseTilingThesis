In this thesis we will first provide historical background and introduce foundational concepts to the study of aperiodic plane tilings, namely, Penrose tilings. We will explore three methods of Penrose tiling construction: inflation and deflation, Up-Down generation, and Pentagrid duals. The features of the Penrose tiling are surprising, and challenge previous notions in tiling theory. We will explore these features, proving the uncountability of Penrose tilings, the admittance of five-fold symmetries, local isomorphism between all Penrose tilings, and the surprising ratio of prototiles. Finally, we will introduce and describe graphical geodesics on the Penrose tiling, and characterize them according to their global meandering.
