@article{Bigatti1998,
abstract = {Since the subject of noncommutative geometry is now entering maturity, we felt there is need for presentation of the material at an undergraduate course level. Our review is a zero order approximation to this project. Thus, the present paper attempts to offer some motivations and mathematical prerequisites for a deeper study or at least to serve as support in glancing at recent results in theoretical physics.},

@book{Gardner1997,
abstract = {Here is another collection drawn from Martin Gardner's 'Mathematical Games' column in Scientific American. Each chapter explores a different theme, for example fractals, surreal numbers, the sculptures of Berrocal, tiling the plane, Ramsey theory and code breaking, all combining to create a rich diet of recreational mathematics. Most chapters can be readily understood by the uninitiated: at each turn there are challenges for the reader and a wealth of references for further reading. Gardner's clarity of style and ability systematically to simplify the complex make this an excellent vehicle in which to start or continue an interest in recreational mathematics.},

In 1618 Kepler discovered the third law of planetary motion relating to the periodic times of the planets to their mean distances from the sun - a crowning achievement that enabled him to bring the "Harmonice mundi" to completeion. The authors have presented and interpreted Kepler's Latin text to readers of English, by putting it into "the kind of clear but earnest language which we suppose Kepler would have used if he had been writing today."},

@article{Luck2000,
abstract = {As Kepler’s Aa tiling is sometimes regarded as the pentagon tiling described by Penrose, the two tilings are compared considering their acceptance domains. The acceptance domain of the Penrose tiling is a decagon, whereas the acceptance domain of Kepler’s Aa tiling looks like a 10-fold toothed wheel; it exhibits a hole in the centre and it has therefore unusual inflation properties. A related tiling proposed by D\"{u}rer a century earlier than Kepler’s starts with an inflated pentagon and D\"{u}rer described the possibility of glueing tiles with random distribution.},
